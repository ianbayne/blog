    <p>Last year, every movie that I watched, every TV show I was hooked on, and every book I finished I made a point of writing down the title and a brief review. While in the future I’d like to design and print a physical newsletter to send to friends and family that would contain this at least in part, this time I’ll make do by using that list as the basis of this post.</p>

<p>In chronological order, here are the movies and TV shows I watched in 2021 along with my reviews as I originally wrote them:</p>

<h2 id="basic-instinct">Basic Instinct</h2>
<p>Great tense psychological thriller with an open ending. They don’t make them like this anymore!</p>

<h2 id="rambo">Rambo</h2>
<p>I liked the idea of it—of an action movie with more depth than usual—but found myself bored for much of it. I suppose I had trouble sympathizing with the main character or in seeing the sheriffs as entirely bad and deserving their comeuppance. Still, I liked that Rambo’s lietuneant was played with more nuance that modern movies would have shown him and the ending scene where Rambo rages against a country that made him a killer and then left him adrift. Even though it was hard to understand what he was saying.</p>

<h2 id="conan-the-barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</h2>
<p>Silly acting and choreography, but a great setting and world-building, never explaining too much, but keeping the audience interested. Sneaking into the snake tower as well as Thulsa Doom’s throne room / orgy party reminded me of Dungeons and Dragons scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-guard">The Old Guard</h2>
<p>Nothing ground-breaking, but decent. I always like anything that deals with the negative aspects of living forever. Especially haunting was the fate of Quenh, locked in an iron maiden and thrown overboard, destined to drown and then come back to life for eternity…</p>

<h2 id="news-of-the-world">News of the World</h2>
<p>Was alright, nothing special.</p>

<h2 id="kodachrome">Kodachrome</h2>
<p>Very predictable. Still, the scene with Ed Harris telling his son he loved him and wished he could have stayed in that moment when his son was a baby and he was making promises to him was super moving!</p>

<h2 id="the-farewell">The Farewell</h2>
<p>Great! Awkwafina was very natural</p>

<h2 id="sound-of-metal">Sound of Metal</h2>

<h2 id="the-prospect">The Prospect</h2>

<h2 id="song-of-the-sea">Song of the Sea</h2>

<h2 id="nomadland">Nomadland</h2>

<h2 id="dog-soldiers">Dog Soldiers</h2>
<p>Much, much better than it has any right to be. Very entertaining!</p>

<h2 id="end-of-watch">End of Watch</h2>
<p>Great! Cop drama.</p>

<h2 id="tales-from-the-loop-show">Tales from the Loop (show)</h2>

<h2 id="cherry">Cherry</h2>
<p>Good editing, music, cinematography, etc., but not a very realistic story.</p>

<h2 id="the-babadook">The Babadook</h2>
<p>Frightening for the first 3/4, not so much afterward.</p>

<h2 id="rebel-in-the-rye">Rebel in the Rye</h2>
<p>Meh</p>

<h2 id="hereditary">Hereditary</h2>
<p>Mostly good, but good weird by the end. Still <em>much</em> better than Midsommar. Happy to see Gabriel Byrne in something again.</p>

<h2 id="the-terror">The Terror</h2>
<p>Great! Makes me want to read the book now.</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>Pretty good! The Endless is a sort of sequel to this.</p>

<h2 id="eurovision">Eurovision</h2>
<p>A couple of chuckles, but otherwise a bit painful</p>

<h2 id="never-grow-old">Never Grow Old</h2>
<p>John Cusack playing against type. Really good!</p>

<h2 id="hotel-artemis">Hotel Artemis</h2>
<p>Good until the uneven and unearned end.</p>

<h2 id="come-and-see">Come and See</h2>
<p>Devastating…</p>

<h2 id="fargo-seasons-14">Fargo, seasons 1–4</h2>
<p>Surprisingly great! Off kilter humor, unique characters, good pace and storylines.</p>

<h2 id="bosch-season-8">Bosch Season 8</h2>
<p>Good, but a bit black and white in how people are portrayed.</p>

<h2 id="courage-under-fire">Courage Under Fire</h2>
<p>Ooh, that was great!</p>

<h2 id="forgetting-sarah-marshall">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</h2>
<p>Re-watch. Still possibly my favorite Judd Apatow.</p>

<h2 id="funny-people">Funny People</h2>
<p>Second (or first?) favorite Judd Apatow movie. This was great!</p>

<h2 id="i-love-you-man">I Love You Man</h2>
<p>Funny mostly.</p>

<h2 id="knocked-up">Knocked Up</h2>
<p>A little too men-are-stupid for me.</p>

<h2 id="good-time">Good Time</h2>
<p>Weird and frenetic!</p>

<h2 id="the-map-of-tiny-perfect-things">The Map of Tiny Perfect Things</h2>
<p>Cute though main girl was a bit annoying.</p>

<h2 id="ikarie-xb-1">IKARIE XB-1</h2>
<p>Czech scifi from 1963. Pacing was weird but some good ideas that have become more mainstream over time.</p>

<h2 id="the-kid">The Kid</h2>
<p>Not a masterpiece but I really enjoyed the depiction of richly developed and complicated good and evil characters. I liked that the kid was drawn to Billy the Kid first, but it was Pat Garrett that was the better man.</p>

<h2 id="palm-springs">Palm Springs</h2>
<p>Great usage of the Groundhog’s Day idea. Main actors had great chemistry.</p>

<h2 id="silence">Silence</h2>
<p>Overly long with some weird characters (Japanese dude who was always sorry) but otherwise really good. Kept me thinking about it for a while. The scene where Adam Driver tries to save some of the believers and thinks the main character had already renounced his religion was very sad. Ending was a bit meh as well.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-valley-of-violence">In a Valley of Violence</h2>
<p>Good though not great. Loved the performance by John Travolta as well as the young girl who fell in love with Ethan Hawke (“I’ve got you”).</p>

<h2 id="eternal-zero">Eternal Zero</h2>
<p>Muddled message. Is it anti-war? Why does the main character join the kamikazes then? Not only does it not make sense, but it glorifies it as well.</p>

<h2 id="into-the-night-season-2">Into the Night, season 2</h2>
<p>Crap. Utter crap. Forced/Manufactured conflict and the story barely moves forward. Most likely will not watch season 3.</p>

<h2 id="slow-west">Slow West</h2>
<p>Meh, not bad, but not great. Unconventional story at least.</p>

<h2 id="free-guy">Free Guy</h2>
<p>Started out great, progressively got worse and more predictable.</p>

<h2 id="nobody">Nobody</h2>
<p>Not as good as the Drinker Recommends said. The bus scene was great but the shootouts and what-not were just kind of boring. Something we’ve all seen countless times before.</p>

<h2 id="white-girl">White Girl</h2>
<p>Not great. Main character was difficult (impossible?) to sympathize with and had no discernable personality of her own. Brian Marc, however, was great as her drug-dealing bf.</p>

<h2 id="dune">Dune</h2>
<p>Great! Ends a bit abruptly. Not sure about Timothy Charlegmange’s acting, at least after his dad dies…</p>

<h2 id="squid-game">Squid Game</h2>
<p>Not particularly innovative, but enjoyable. Some of the backstabbing was very sad… Like when San’u tricks Ali.</p>

<h2 id="thelma-and-louise">Thelma and Louise</h2>
<p>Likely an important movie at the time, but watching it now, the main characters were just kind of dumb and most of how things turn out are their fault.</p>

<h2 id="dirty-dancing">Dirty Dancing</h2>
<p>Not terrible, not great. Father-daughter scenes were cute. Was weird to see the older sister in Ferris Bueller in a sexual role. Patrick Swayze’s character was really a dick at first. And lastly: The title is pretty misleading.</p>

<h2 id="appaloosa">Appaloosa</h2>
<p>Excellent! Great acting, great characterization, plot was good, didn’t feel rushed.</p>

<h2 id="open-range">Open Range</h2>
<p>Really good even though I don’t think so much of Kevin C’s acting capabilities. Love angle seemed forced. Ending shoot out was great even if it seemed the good guys were mostly winning throughout. Nice to have even a semi-realistic shoot-out.</p>

<h2 id="duel">Duel</h2>
<p>Spielberg’s first (?). Nice ratcheting up of tension. Overly long, however.</p>

<h2 id="invincible">Invincible</h2>
<p>Nice inversion of some of the super hero tropes. I liked how realistic a lot of it was (Robot clones Rex and transfers his mind into the clone then shows up and expects everything to be normal, which Monster Girl calls him on)</p>

<h2 id="the-proposition">The Proposition</h2>
<p>Not as good as I was expecting. Not very much happened, every scene seems overly impregnated with meaning to an annoying extent. The soundtrack was middling, the weird poetry while Guy Pierce headed off to find his brother alone was odd, etc. I did like that the captain initially seems like the typical vindictive law enforcer but winds up very tender in regard to his wife. Gave him extra dimensionality.</p>

<h2 id="do-the-right-thing">Do The Right Thing</h2>
<p>Fantastic! Very bright and colorful characters ranging across the spectrum, despite the acting not always being very realistic. Grabbed hold of you though and didn’t let go. I don’t agree with what Mooky did (unless he was doing it to distract the mob from hurting Sal and sons…?) but thought provoking nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="the-colony">The Colony</h2>
<p>Started off very promising and gripping (although with a bit too much shaky cam) but devolved into illogicality and cliches. Slowly stopped caring and all the plot points were as expected. The tanker made me think of Water World.</p>

<p>And the books I read:</p>

<h2 id="the-third-reich-in-power">The Third Reich in Power</h2>
<p>Fact-packed, but ponderous and with poorly constructed sentences that make the information  more difficult to consume than necessary. Most interesting to me were all the areas the Third Reich <em>was</em> socialist such as with the Strength through Joy and other programs.</p>

<h2 id="greenlights">Greenlights</h2>
<p>Overly psuedo-deep and psuedo-intellectual. He seems like a decent dude, but he hasn’t really lived an interesting enough life to warrant anyone reading his biography.</p>

<h2 id="the-wehrmacht-retreats-fighting-a-lost-war-1943">The Wehrmacht Retreats: Fighting a Lost War, 1943</h2>
<p>Great analysis and very well written! Fascinating to hear that the Wehrmacht didn’t know / couldn’t undertand any other way to wage war other than to be always attacking. Also interesting to hear the different ways of waging war each nation exemplified. US? High firepower and speed.</p>

<h2 id="wool">Wool</h2>
<p>Amazing!</p>

<h2 id="shift">Shift</h2>
<p>Pretty good!</p>

<h2 id="dust">Dust</h2>
<p>Just alright…</p>

<h2 id="bram-stokers-dracula">Bram Stoker’s Dracula</h2>
<p>Don’t really remember, took too long to complete and I was spacing out too much</p>

<h2 id="the-devil-in-the-white-city">The Devil in the White City</h2>
<p>Great!</p>

<h2 id="the-forgotten-highlander">The Forgotten Highlander</h2>
<p>Brutal!</p>

<h2 id="radical-acceptance">Radical Acceptance</h2>
<p>Some good advice</p>

<h2 id="cant-hurt-me">Can’t Hurt Me</h2>
<p>Some inspiring physical accomplishments, but…</p>

<h2 id="the-terror-1">The Terror</h2>
<p>Better than the show! Amazing!</p>

<h2 id="erebus">Erebus</h2>
<p>Cool to get more backstory likes trips to Antarctica. Also fascinating to hear that maybe some of the expedition, after leaving the ship, returned to them</p>

<h2 id="how-ike-led">How Ike Led</h2>
<p>Really good, albeit almost certainly biased (his granddaughter, after all). Neat to hear about someone who led for all Americans instead of his power base.</p>

<h2 id="abominable">Abominable</h2>
<p>Started out okay but got progressively worse…</p>

<h2 id="four-hour-workweek">Four Hour Workweek</h2>
<p>Tim Ferriss is a used car salesman, although there were some interesting ideas.</p>

<h2 id="three-body-problem-series-three-body-problem-dark-forest-deaths-end">Three Body Problem series (Three Body Problem, Dark Forest, Death’s End)</h2>
<p>Some creative ideas (although maybe not when compared to other grand masters of the genre) but terrible characterization, motivations etc. People make illogical choices just to further the plot and there’s a prepondency of deus ex machina.</p>

<h2 id="the-inner-game-of-tennis-the-classic-guide-to-the-mental-side-of-peak-performance">The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance</h2>
<p>Excellent! Great tips not only relevant to playing at peak performance but in general to quieting down Self 1 (conscious self) to let Self 2 get on with it, such as removing judgment (you didn’t play bad, you missed x number of shots) and concentrating on subtle things (the pattern on the tennis ball, etc.) to distract Self 1 and keep it from interfering.</p>

<h2 id="berlin-the-downfall-1945">Berlin: The Downfall 1945</h2>
<p>Quite good although sometimes the sentences were structured awkwardly and Antony Beevor is guilty of assuming his audience speaks German. HUGE cast of characters. Should have kept a list to refer to.</p>

<h2 id="dividing-the-spoils">Dividing the Spoils</h2>
<p>The right balance of facts and good storytelling! And well foot-noted / referenced. This was great!</p>

<h2 id="griftopia">Griftopia</h2>
<p>Matt Tiabbi. Good, but he’s an ameature in the field so unsure how accurate his assessments are. Lots of info; requires a re-reading with notepad and pencil in hand to really understand.</p>

<h2 id="leviathan-falls">Leviathan Falls</h2>
<p>Hmm… Not great. Too many logical errors (why did they agree to x from Tanaka??), too many characters I didn’t care about (Kit? Yawn), too many badasses, etc. Just amaetur hour. Oh well.</p>

<h2 id="re-read-the-war-of-art">Re-read: The War of Art</h2>
