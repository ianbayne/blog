Lately I've been working my way through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/a7o9h/a_pdf_compilation_of_the_recipes_i_found/) pdf compilation of recipes from an askreddit thread to broaden my resume of go-to meals. <!-- more -->I believe the original conceit was to provide a collection of cheap recipes for college students. 

Despite what could be an opportunity for a plethora of top ramen recipes, there are some real treats inside. A recent favorite is this one, dubbed 96 Hours of Chicken by its unnamed chef:

- Night 1: Buy a whole chicken. Roast it, make gravy w/ the pan drippings and eat a thigh and leg w/ mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Reserve bones.
- Night 2: Take meat off chicken make a curry or stir fry with some of the meat and some veggies. Serve with rice.
- Night 3: Make tacos with left over meat.
- Night 4: Use the chicken stock that you should have made on day 2 to make a delicious chicken soup w/ left over meat and other stuff.

The concept is the essence of simplicity, but something about baking a single chicken and then eating it over four days in different meals appeals to me. After all, using every part of the chicken gets you those buffalo-hunter brownie points. 

Anyway, here's the soup I made on night fourâ€”delish!
